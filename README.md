# Disrupting Financial Services/Payments in Latin America
## Overview and Origin

As the mobile phone market has grown and more people globally gain internet access, the world as we know it will continue to evolve.  These trends to digital have forced many firms to conduct business online.  While countries such as the U.S. and China have seen these shifts largely take place, countries in the developing world have not.  With cellphone usage and internet access in the developing world on the rise,payments and financial service firms are primed for disruption especially in Latin America.  

One of the disruptors in this space is PagSeguro, a Brazilian electronic payments company.  PagSeguro was founded in 2006 out of Universo Online, also known as UOL group.  "UOL group was founded in 1996 by Grupo Folha, and is currently the second largest media conglomerate in Brazil."  Initially, PagSeguro was intended to be a financial service platform.  However, after UOL group acquired BrPay in January 2007, PagSeguro (PAGS) was  formally incorporated 6 months later. 

"Given UOL was Brazil’s largest internet content, digital products and services company, UOL felt like they needed to create a payment platform to provide the digital payment infrastructure necessary for e-commerce growth that was forming in Brazil."  Though PagSeguro has remained a payments company, the company really started to make waves in "2013 when they expanded from online payments to point-of-sales payments or POS payments." "PagSeguro continues to look for ways to provide financial technology solutions focused primarily on consumers, individual entrepreneurs, micro-merchants, small companies and medium-sized companies in Brazil." This is significant because "~99% of businesses in Brazil are mirco-merchants and small-medium sized enterprises."  PagSeguro thought this contingent was ripe for disruption because they continue to be underserved by traditional Brazilian financial institutions.  

Unlike majority of start-ups today, PagSeguro didn’t have to raise money given they were formed by UOL group, and were able to scale-up after the acquisition of BrPay.  However, PagSeguro did go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in January 2018.  PagSeguro's public offering ended up being the largest public offering since SNAP, which was a year earlier.  "PagSeguro was able to raise $2.3Bn, which was in the top 5 largest IPOs for 2018." This goes to show what public investors think of the FinTech space and in this specific case, payments. 

## Business Activities: 

With "99% of Brazilian business falling under the SME or micro merchant category," many of these merchants have historically been underserved by the traditional Brazilian banking system.  These merchants have been underserved because they are deemed to be a higher credit risk for a financial institution, and many of these businesses may be in an area where there is little to no banking presence.  One of the unique characteristics of PagSeguro is that they provide solutions to both the customer and merchant.  Currently PagSeguro is utilizing point-of-sales (POS) devices, which is one of the primary drivers of the company’s revenue.  With much of PagSeguro’s current business model surrounding the POS terminals and transactional activities, it makes PagSeguro comparable to that of Square, one of the leading payment companies and POS providers in the U.S.  One of the unique features of PagSeguro’s POS business is they allow merchants to own PagSeguro’s devices.  Historically merchants would have to rent POS devices from other payment companies.  Though PagSeguro’s POS business may sound quite simple, PagSeguro is actually providing “cash-in solutions” for merchants that use these devices.  In fact, PagSeguro allows merchants to offer 37 cash-in methods.  These 37 cash-in methods can include: “web checkout, in-app checkout or in-person using our POS devices, credit and debit cards, meal vouchers, boletos, peer to peer and wire transfers and bank debits, instant payments, Instant wire transfers (TEDs), issuance of boletos that can be paid electronically or at any bank branch.”  PagSeguro also offers merchants, “many management tools to help grow and expand the merchant’s business.”  These tools include: “software functionalities such as sales reports, credit and debit reconciliation and inventory control.”  PagSeguro is also beneficial for merchants, as they have an easy and simple onboarding process.  

From both the merchant and the consumer perspective, PagSeguro also offers many cash-out solutions.  These solutions include: “online purchases via eWallet, PagSeguro pre-paid cards and cash cards, on platform peer-to-peer transfers, instant central bank wire transfers, top-up pre-paid mobile phones, as well as QR transactions with PagSeguro terminals.”  The broad swath of offerings from PagSeguro helps both the consumer and the merchants as it creates flexibility and provide easier ways of making payments, that otherwise may have been difficult to make.

Now since PagSeguro is forming a digital bank, PagBank, they are able to take the solutions they already provide to consumers and merchants to the next step.  From the consumer side, given the current process to open up a bank account can be cumbersome, “PagBank utilizes a fully online onboarding process. This makes for fasters turnarounds, as well as higher acceptance rates.”  Over the summer PagSeguro issued a secondary offering, where they were planning to use the proceeds “to continue taking advantage of new market opportunities by ramping up investments in new technologies, products and services for its digital ecosystem.”   These investment could include machine learning applications to better their current underwriting practices or continuing to improve their account opening process.   With the launch of PagBank, the company will be able to offer: “free digital accounts that PagSeguro provides to its consumers and merchants with functionalities such as bill payments, top up prepaid mobile phone, Uber, Spotify and/or Google Play credits, wire transfers, peer to peer transfers, prepaid credit cards, cash cards, loans, investments, QR code payments, and payroll portability, among other digital banking services.”  Today, technology firms competitive advantage, or moat, is associated with the network effects that the company can create.  According to Billy Gurley, a venture capital investor and partner at Benchmark , a network effect is “a marketplace that can provide a better experience to customer “n+1000” than it did to customer “n” directly as a function of adding 1000 more participants to the market.”  With the shift towards a digital bank, PagSeguro should be able to strengthen their network effect as "PagSeguro’s merchants/clients would be able to set-up payroll and direct deposits to their PagBank digital account."  This would create more users for PagSeguro because merchants could easily set-up direct deposits for their employees.  In turn those employees could utilize their digital account for other means of transactions, which would create more transaction volumes for PagSeguro and so on.  

## Landscape: 

PagSeguro is a firm in the payments, and specifically the electronic payments industry.  Electronic payments has certainly been high growth industry and powerful investment theme over the last few years.  Electronic payments have benefitted from many trends, but the most important one has been the increase of digitization of the world around us.  “Typically, payments have taken place in two separate experiences, either in store purchases or online.  However, with the growing usage of mobile phones globally, these two separate experiences have been converging.  Now we see customers paying with apps or eWallets on their phone.  This has made the payment process more “invisible.”  For example, think about the Uber App and how it has your credit card information linked in the app.  This makes the payment/tip process to the driver hassle free especially when compared to paying for a yellow cab.  The continue shift towards the “invisibility” of the payment process continues as more purchases will take place either on mobile apps or from eWallets.  According to a Business Insider payments report, “mobile payments are expected to grow by a 62% CAGR through 2021.  This would bring U.S. mobile payment volumes to $274Bn.” “When you look at global mobile payment volumes, they reached $897Bn in 2019 and are forecasted to rise to $3Trn by 2024.” The trend to contactless payments has made it easier for consumers as they do not have to worry about carrying around as much cash as they would have.  

Though PagSeguro is a local player in Brazil, the major payment and e-payment companies in the global domain include: “Stripe, Square, Paypal, Braintree, Recurly, Ayden and Zuora.”  However, some of PagSeguro’s more direct competitors include: “Stone, Cielo, PagBrasil, Rede, Getnet, and SumUp payments.”   

## Results: 

Though the path for PagSeguro has not been easy, as the path for any disruptor, PagSeguro has been making headway and has seen some strong results thus far.  Even despite the hyper competitive environment in which PagSeguro competes, and the strong regulatory headwinds that challenged the Brazilian e-payment community in 2018, “PagSeguro was able to attain a 33% penetration rate, of the 13 million businesses incorporated in Brazil.”  PagSeguro’s commitment to making the best payment devices and experience was recognized when the company was awarded the "Best Payment Method" by the Congresso Afiliados Brasil (Brazil Affiliates Congress).”  Another way to judge PagSeguro’s success would be based on its stock performance.  Though PagSeguro’s stock was challenged in 2018 and has recently corrected over the last few months, PagSeguro has been able to maintain solid performance since its IPO and on a YTD basis.  In fact, PagSeguro is up ~77% this year.  This compares to the S&P 500 which is up ~30% and Brazil’s stock exchange which is up ~22%.  Though PagSeguro has lagged competitor Stone, which is up 106% this year, PagSeguro has significantly outperformed Cielo, which is down ~8% this year.  Even despite the weak performance post its IPO in January 2018, given the concerns around the regulatory environment as well as increasing competition, PagSeguro has generated returns that are better than the market and in some cases that of its competitors.  Since its IPO on the NYSE in 2018, PagSeguro is up ~55%.  This is compares to the S&P which is up ~14%, and Brazil’s stock exchange which is up ~6% over that timeframe.  Though Stone has outperformed PagSeguro in both period windows, Stone’s outperformance since PagSeguro’s IPO has been a meager 3%, as Stone is up just over 58% over that time frame.  However, Cielo which is another one of PagSeguro’s competitors is down more than 75% since PagSeguro’s IPO.   While stock price, shouldn’t be the only metric to judge the company’s success, PagSeguro’s strong stock performance since January 2018 tells you that investors and market participants continue to believe in the company, its business model and strategy. 

Some of the primary core metrics to judge PagSeguro would include total addressable market (TAM) and total payment volumes (TPV).  As mentioned above, PagSeguro currently has a “33% penetration rate of Brazil’s 13 million businesses.”  Initially, one would think that this is a small total addressable market, or an unattractive one given its finite upside.  However, when thinking about PagSeguro’s shift to a digital bank, that could increase the size of their total addressable market, especially as you being to offer other services that you had not previously.  PagBank could also increase PagSeguro’s total addressable market as “some estimate that Brazil’s unbanked population is about 68 million people.”  Once again, this highlights that a sizable portion of the Brazilian economy is underserved and that PagSeguro could have a first mover advantage.  

PagSeguro’s total addressable market could also extend past the Brazil's borders, if the company continues to focus on global remittances.  Actually, the World Bank “estimates that officially recorded annual remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached $529 billion in 2018, an increase of 9.6 percent over the previous record high of $483 billion in 2017. Global remittances, which include flows to high-income countries, reached $689 billion in 2018, up from $633 billion in 2017.”  If PagSeguro would shift more of its focus to global remittances, PagSeguro could also increase its total addressable market. 

The other core metric in which PagSeguro is measure upon would be total payment volumes (TPV), where PagSeguro continues to see strong growth.  In fact, “PagSeguro has been able to grow total payment volumes by around 40-50% on a year-over-year basis.”   While this is strong growth, analysts are expecting TPV growth to slow given the tougher comps and increased competition.  However, given the shift to PagBank, the TPV metric may not be as important to PagSeguro down the road.   

## Recommendations: 

Even despite PagSeguro doing a very good job in trying to stay ahead of the curve, especially as they try to evolve into a digital bank from a payments company, there are still things that PagSeguro can do better.  Despite the favorable macro trends that PagSeguro has, they should look for ways to evolve and grow their client base.  While many articles have been written about the secular growth of payment companies in developing nations, given the increasing usage of cards, internet and mobiles, payments companies have a tremendous amount of capacity.  While PagSeguro has the first mover advantage amongst micro and SME merchants, PagSeguro should be looking for ways to gather larger corporations as clients.  Though PagSeguro labels themselves a disruptor, if they really want to change the banking system and payments business, they need to move past just servicing micro-merchants.  One has to think if PagSeguro starts to service larger corporations, they would lessen their sensitivity to the business cycle.  While a vast majority of businesses in Brazil are made up of small/medium size enterprises as well as micro merchants, if Brazil enters an economic slump many of these companies will struggle and could possibly go bankrupt.  This would hurt PagSeguro’s business model given their focus on underserviced firms in the Brazilian economy.  While this has been a positive for PagSeguro’s business model, it also makes them more susceptible to potential credit events. 

Another recommendation for PagSeguro would be to explore blockchain products or service offerings.  Blockchain could be important to Brazil because it is a developing economy and presents a sizable market for remittances.  Since remittances take a long-time to settle, blockchain appears to be a leading solution for faster and more timely settlements.  In fact, PagSeguro in their F-1 listed blockchain as a threat to their current business model.  While challenging, if PagSeguro moved into the blockchain business it could become a player or even a disruptor in global payments/remittances.  PagSeguro could also have a first mover advantage in utilizing a blockchain solution for remittances, given the currency weakness that many Latin American countries have experienced over the past year and a half.  Utilizing blockchain solutions would not only help people transfer money back to family or friends in another country, it could also help users preserve their net worth as it may provide protection from currency depreciation episodes. 
The use of blockchain for remittances is also important because Mckinsey "estimated that blockchain technologies could save as much as $50-60bn in business to business payments cost."  This could be beneficial to PagSeguro as they look to diversify their client base and look to build out their business-to-business commerce segment through PagBank.  Structurally, utilizing blockchain for remittances could be beneficial for Brazil and other developing economies.  This is because remittances are stickier than gross capital flows.  What does this mean, if a country has a balance of payments deficit that is funded by debt or portfolio capital flows, that country is at a higher risk of capital flight.  However, if funded through remittances, that country’s funding source will be less volatile and less susceptible to capital flight.  So, if PagSeguro focused on utilizing the blockchain for remittances, not only would they make the settlement of remittances easier, they would also help developing nations find a more stable funding sources.
